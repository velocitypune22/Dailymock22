FileHandler


	Step 1: Screen shot using selenium can be taken using Takescreenshot Interface.
	First type cast the driver object to Takesscreenshot interface
	Ex:
	((TakesScreenshot)driver)
	After interface we have to call method getScreeenshot As(), here we neeed to pass argument “OutputType.FILE”.
This method getScreenshotAs() will object of type FILE.
((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
When we execute this statement screen will be taken and to store it into variable which is of type FILE as below:

File source = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
Step2:  This screen is available inside system memory.

TO get this screenshot into our local drive create one folder and pass pthat folder variable path to File Class object as below

File  destination = new File(“path of local driver with .jpg/.jpeg extession”)

Step3: To copy screenshot from system memory to local memory use FileHandler class
FileHandler.copy(source, destination);

In which case we will take screenshot:
1.	When Test case gets fail
2.	For login page to verify whether login performing using correct credentials.
